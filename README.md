Developed on streamlit (python framework).

The main objective of the project is to recommend hotels to user using three different parameters, by price, by amenities and by rating.

The dataset used for this project is from kaggle, the dataset is the list of hotel details from goibibo.com, I have altered the dataset for this project and compressed it's size.
